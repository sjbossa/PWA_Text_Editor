# PWA 'JATE' Text Editor

## Description
The JATE application is a web text editor where users can create notes or code snippets with or 
without an internet connection and where they can reliably retrieve their notes for later use. The 
integrated Cache API's help to ensure that the application will remain fully functional even without 
an active internet connection--which allows the user to access their visited pages even if the 
application is not online.
